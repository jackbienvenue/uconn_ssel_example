# Getting Started with Quarto 

Quarto is a great tool for doing your project programming, and is my personal favorite for programming projects. It supports Python and R simultaneously, and you can work with Quarto Markdown (.qmd) files in RStudio, Jupyter, or VS Code. 

In Quarto Markdown files, you can do your writing in regular markdown language and build in code chunks for your programming tasks. Code chunks started with three back-apostrophes and when curly braces specifying the language. They look like this, minus the # signs.

<pre>``` {python} 
Your code goes here 
```
</pre>

When rendered, they look like this:

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Basketball data example (NBA)
url = "https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2025_per_game.html"
tables = pd.read_html(url)
df = tables[0]
df = df[df['Player'] != 'Player']
df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
print(df[df['Player'] == 'Giannis Antetokounmpo'])
```

Quarto Markdown files are awesome! I recommend trying them out.
