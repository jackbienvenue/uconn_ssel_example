# Getting Started with R Markdown

R Markdown is a great tool for combining your writing and programming in a single document. It's perfect for data analysis, reporting, and reproducible research. You can use R Markdown in **RStudio**, and it supports both **R** and **Python** code (with some setup).

In an R Markdown file, you write your main content in **Markdown**, and insert **code chunks** for your programming work. Code chunks begin and end with **three backticks**, and the chunk starts with curly braces to specify the language. They look like this (remove the `#` signs when using):

R Markdown files are best used in RStudio. Downloading RStudio is a good idea, even if you plan to code in VS Code, to ensure that your R code runs.

Like Quarto Markdown files, code chunks are opened with three backticks (this symbol: ` ) followed by {r}, and closed with three more backticks.

Here's an example of using an R code chunk in an .rmd file:

```{r}
# Generate 1000 random numbers from a normal distribution
data <- rnorm(1000, mean = 50, sd = 10)

# Create a histogram
hist(data,
     main = "Histogram of Normally Distributed Data",
     xlab = "Value",
     col = "lightblue",
     border = "black")
```
