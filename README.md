# NCAA Basketball's Turnaround Teams' Secrets

The NCAA March Madness tournaments are the most memorable sports tournaments of the year. Getting there is no easy task. The pressure is on all season long for teams to perform. 

Unfortunately, bad years are inevitable for any program. Where should your team focus its energy if you find yourself in a rut? Let's use a machine learning approach to find some of the key characteristics of NCAA basketball teams who improved their performance between the 2024 and 2025 seasons.

## Project Description

### Background

Whether the goal is making a playoff run, just punching a ticket to the postseason, or hustling a little more than last season, every NCAA team is looking to improve its performance. 

Struggling teams may be able to use the results of this project for a data-guided improvement plan for their lineup ahead of a new season.

For college basketball fans, little is more frustrating than their team struggling!
